Suppose temperature is measured using a nominal scale, where the categories are hot, warm, mild, and cool. It would not be appropriate to perform a correlation analysis between the temperature and ice cream sales since there is no inherent order or value to the temperature categories. If the temperature is measured using an interval scale, such as degrees Celsius, a correlation analysis can be performed, and more meaningful conclusions can be drawn about the relationship between temperature and ice cream sales."

    "2) Median: \n",
    "    The median is the middle value in a dataset. It is calculated by arranging the values in order from lowest to highest and finding the middle value.

    "3) Mode: \n",
    "    The mode is the most common value in a dataset. It is the value that occurs most frequently. The mode is useful in datasets where the most common value is of interest. For example, in a dataset of exam scores, the mode may be useful in determining the most common grade.\n",

    "4) Interquartile range (IQR): \n",
    "    The IQR is the range of the middle 50% of values in a dataset. It is calculated by subtracting the first quartile (the 25th percentile) from the third quartile (the 75th percentile). The IQR is a robust measure of variability as it is not affected by outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Variance: \n",
    "    The variance is a measure of how spread out a dataset is. It is calculated by taking the average of the squared differences between each value and the mean. The variance provides information on the variability of the dataset, but the units of variance are squared, making it difficult to interpret.\n",
