    "Q5) State advantages and disadvantages of multithreading\n",
    "\n",
    "-->\n",
    "Advantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Improved performance: \n",
    "    a.Multithreading can significantly improve the performance of a program by allowing it to utilize multiple cores or CPUs to \n",
    "      perform tasks simultaneously. \n",
    "    b.This can result in faster execution times and better overall system responsiveness.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2.Better resource utilization:\n",
    "    a.Multithreading can also improve resource utilization by allowing multiple threads to share resources, \n",
    "    such as memory or network connections, more efficiently. This can help reduce resource contention and improve system scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Simplified program design: \n",
    "    a.Multithreading can simplify the design of complex programs by allowing different tasks to \n",
    "        be performed concurrently in separate threads. \n",
    "    b.This can help make programs easier to write and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Asynchronous processing: \n",
    "    a.Multithreading can also enable asynchronous processing, which allows a program to \n",
    "        continue executing other tasks while waiting for I/O operations or other long-running operations to complete.\n",
    "    b.This can improve system responsiveness and efficiency.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Disadvantages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Increased complexity: \n",
    "    a.Multithreading can make programs more complex and harder to debug, especially when multiple threads are accessing shared resources.\n",
    "    b.This can lead to race conditions, deadlocks, and other synchronization issues that are difficult to resolve.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Synchronization overhead:\n",
    "    a.Multithreading can also introduce synchronization overhead, as threads must coordinate their access to \n",
    "    shared resources to prevent conflicts. \n",
    "    b.This can result in reduced performance, especially when many threads are accessing the same resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Non-deterministic behavior: \n",
    "    a.Multithreading can introduce non-deterministic behavior, as the order of execution of different threads may be unpredictable. \n",
    "    b.This can make it harder to reason about the behavior of a program and make it more difficult to reproduce bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Increased memory usage: \n",
    "    a.Multithreading can also increase memory usage, as each thread requires its own stack and other data structures. \n",
    "    b.This can be a problem in memory-constrained environments, such as embedded systems or mobile devices."

    "Q6) Explain deadlocks and race conditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-->\n",
    "1.Deadlock:\n",
    "    a.A deadlock occurs when two or more threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release a shared resource, \n",
    "        resulting in a situation where none of the threads can proceed. \n",
    "    b.This can happen when each thread holds a resource that the other thread needs, and neither thread can release \n",
    "        its resource until it acquires the resource it needs from the other thread.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "    suppose Thread A holds a lock on Resource 1 and is waiting to acquire a lock on Resource 2, \n",
    "    while Thread B holds a lock on Resource 2 and is waiting to acquire a lock on Resource 1. In this scenario, \n",
    "    both threads are blocked and waiting for each other to release the resource they need, resulting in a deadlock.\n",
    "\n",
    "Race Condition:\n",
    "A race condition occurs when two or more threads access a shared resource concurrently, and the final result depends on the timing or order of the thread execution. This can lead to unpredictable behavior or incorrect results, as different threads may overwrite each other's changes or read outdated values.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, suppose two threads, Thread A and Thread B, are accessing a shared variable x. Thread A increments x by 1, while Thread B multiplies x by 2. If Thread A executes first, x will be incremented by 1 and then multiplied by 2, resulting in x being equal to (1 + 1) * 2 = 4. However, if Thread B executes first, x will be multiplied by 2 and then incremented by 1, resulting in x being equal to (0 * 2) + 1 = 1."
