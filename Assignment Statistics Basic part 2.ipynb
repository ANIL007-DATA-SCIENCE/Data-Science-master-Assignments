    "    Mean is the average value of a dataset and is calculated by adding up all the values in the dataset and dividing by the number of values. \n",

    "        1.Range is the difference between the largest and smallest values in a dataset. \n",
    "        2.Variance measures how spread out the values in a dataset are from the mean, and standard deviation is the square root of the variance. \n",
    "        \n",
    "    These measures can provide information about the variability of a dataset, which is important when comparing and analyzing data. \n",
    "    \n",
    "    For example:\n",

    "-->\n",
    "    Covariance is a measure of the direction of the linear relationship between two variables, \n",
    "    while correlation measures both the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. \n",
    "    Covariance is affected by the scale of the variables, while correlation is not.\n",

    "-->\n",
    "    Outliers can affect measures of central tendency and dispersion:\n",
    "        1.If there are extreme values in a dataset, the mean can be pulled in the direction of the outlier, making it an unreliable measure of central tendency. \n",
    "        Similarly, outliers can affect measures of dispersion such as variance and standard deviation, which are sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "        For example, if a dataset has an outlier value of 100, the standard deviation will be larger than if the outlier value was removed."
